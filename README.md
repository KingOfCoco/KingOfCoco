#### __Hello, world!__

Me llamo _Elysium_.

I'm just a child with a gun. I love writing code, debugging it, and seeing my creations come to life.
It may be extremely frustrating at times, but I still enjoy it. 

Because I'm no expert whith pretty much zero experience, my code is... not the best. But, I consider it all just for fun
so I'm not really trying to get 'proper' code. Just code that works and is mildly fast (nobody likes to wait!).


I'm from Argentina, so...
``` Viva la patria! ```
